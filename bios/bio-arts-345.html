<p><b>Brad Rubenstein</b> was most recently chairman of the New York Festival of Song, and has been investing in and raising capital for musical and theatrical productions for over ten years. By day, he is a project coach for the Celerity Consulting Group, working with high-technology and high-finance companies to get their projects done on time.</p>
<p>Brad is also the chief technical officer of Blog Carnival, which he founded with his colleague Steven Damron in early 2005. </p>
<p>He has an ongoing passion for coaching project teams, and is proud to be affiliated with both the Celerity Consulting Group and Weigend Associates, causing teams in high-tech and high-finance companies around the world to accelerate their projects. </p>
<p>Although Brad is a native Californian (born in Los Gatos), he grew up in various Southeast Asian capitals. His music career was launched with his opera debut in the title role of Amahl and the Night Visitors (1974) with the (now defunct) Bangkok Opera Society at the age of 13. He graduated first in his class at Jakarta International School, before moving back to California in 1978. </p>
<p>Brad began performing with the San Francisco Symphony Chorus while completing his Computer Science Ph.D. dissertation at the University of California, Berkeley, after which he is proud to have been the founding director of the first company chorus at Sun Microsystems, Inc, where he designed database software applications as a member of their technical staff. After a brief internship at l'Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique in Paris, he continued singing (and occasionally serving as a language coach) with the San Francisco Symphony while working as the Director of Engineering for Quorum Software Systems, a small start-up that developed cross-operating-system compatibility platforms. </p>
<p>In 1994, he moved to New York to work in the Derivatives Strategies group at Goldman Sachs. He served as a Vice-President of their core infrastructure team until his retirement in 2001. Since then, he has sung with, and served on the board of, the Dessoff Choirs, and has stood on most of the world's famous stages (often while no one was looking). </p>
